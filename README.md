I'm a **Computer Engineering student** with a passion for backend development and game development.  
I love understanding how systems work under the hood and building software that is clean, efficient, and meaningful.


I’ve studied subjects like data structures, algorithms, Java OOP, C programming, databases, PL/SQL, and computer architecture, and I use them to build projects that help me grow as an engineer.

I love backend work because it lets me design systems that are reliable and purposeful. I enjoy game development because it challenges my logic, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Above all, I code because I want to build things that make sense, solve problems, and show the best of what I can do.
